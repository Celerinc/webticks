## Development Workflow

## Code Guidelines

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic

## AI-Generated Code

We welcome the use of AI tools to help with development. However, we encourage all contributors to fully understand any generated code before pushing to avoid unexpected bugs or issues down the line.

If you use AI tools to generate code (vibe coding), please:

- **Review all generated code** before committing
- **Test thoroughly** to ensure it works as expected
- **Check for security issues** or unintended behavior
- **Understand what the code does** - don't push code you can't explain

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Node version, package version)
